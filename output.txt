<p><strong>The First Three Rules for Working 
with Probability
</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Formal Probability
</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 1. What’s the probability that a Japanese M&M’s survey respondent selected at 
random preferred either pink or teal?
</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Plan Decide which rules to use and
check the conditions they require.
</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion Interpret your results in the
proper context.
</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 2. If we pick two respondents at random, what’s the probability that they both said
purple?
</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Plan The word “both” suggests we want
P(A and B), which calls for the Multiplica-
tion Rule. Think about the assumption.
</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion Interpret your results in the
proper context.
</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
